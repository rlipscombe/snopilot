# snopilot

snopilot was formed to develop hardware and software for getting the most out of mountain activities.

Both of snopilot's founders and original employees have now moved on to bigger and better things, so we've stopped development of our PC application, snotrack.

Rather than simply abandon the source code, we decided to release it as open source under the GPL.
